# Epic Loot #

Epic Loot is a mobile and desktop game for the [js13kGames][] 2017 competition.

## Credits ##

Epic Loot is based on Mike Richey's [Decktet][] game [Tinker, Sailor, Soldier, Spy][tsss].

### Graphics ###

The sprites are edits and recolors of [Jerom's 32x32 fantasy tileset][sprites].
They're under the same [CC BY-SA 3.0][ccas] license as the originals. All the
other graphics were created with HTML5 and CSS3. The paper design comes from
[Craig Butler's tutorial on drawing paper curls][paper]. The random offsets on
gems come from [Paul Underwood's randomized photographs][offset]. The gems
themselves are based on [F. Stephen Kirschbaum's CSS LED lights][led], but
without the glow effect. The dice are my own design.

### Colors ###

Colors for the gems were chosen from [Martin Krzywinski's notes on palettes for
color blindness][color].
